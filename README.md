# canvas-snake-js
### [LIVE PROJECT](https://canersezgin.github.io/canvas-snake-js/)
This is an old famous game which was built with **canvas, javascript & jquery**. <br>
The main point of this project was creating something by using canvas but I tried to make it better by adding a couple of extra features

### Features
- **Level System** was developed. After feeding snake 5 times, you will level up. 
(The game will speed up/get difficult but you will gain more points)
- **Scoreboards** were created. The scores of the last 5 games and your higher 5 scores at all times can be seen on the board.
(Localstorage's used)

### Rooms for improvement
- This project was not developed by taking **visual quality** into consideration.
